AWS Architect Associate certification notes


*Amazon S3*

[What is S3?]
 S3 is a cloud-based service that allows users to store and retrieve data through the use of 'buckets'
- Provides you with unlimited storage (technically)

[S3 Security]
Bucket Policies
- Define permissions for entire S3 buckets
AWS PrivateLink:
- Enables private network access to S3 (bypasses public internet for security)
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- Allows restricted resources on a web page from another domain
IAM Access Analyzer
- Analyzes resource policies to ID risks
Internetwork Traffic Privacy
- Encrypts data between AWS services and Internet

*Notes*
- #1 security misconfiguration for S3 buckets is unrestricted access

**Sub-Topics**
Object Storage
- Data storage architecture that manages data as objects
S3 Console
- Interface for user to upload and access data

-------------------

*S3 Objects*

S3 Object
- Contains data (akin to files), but are NOT infrastructure. These objects may consist of:
-- Key: name of the object
-- Value: the data itself
--- Individual objects can be between 0 Bytes and 5 Terabytes in size
-- VersionID: available when versioning is enabled
-- Metadata: additional info tied to the object

**Object Sub-Topics**
- Etags: Way to detect when object contents are changed *without* downloading the contents
-- Value is represented by a hashing function (MD5/SHA-1)
-- Used for revalidation for cashing systems (assists with versioning)
-- Does *not* reflect changes to metadata, only object contents
- Object Prefixes: Simulates file-system folders in a flat hierarchy
- Checksums
- Object Metadata
-- S3 allows you to attach metadata to S3 Objects
-- System-Defined Metadata: data that only Amazon can control (generally)
-- User-Defined Metadata: must start wtih 'x-amz-meta-' amd allows you to define whatever you wish
- Object tags: used for resource tagging at the object level
- Object Locking: makes data files immutable either indefinitely or fixed period of time
-- Utilizes WORM (Write Once, Read Many) feature
--- Useful with Healthcare/Finance where things are audited heavily
-- Allows prevention of object deletion (turned on at creation of the *bucket*) for data integrity and regulatory compliance

- Versioning

-------------------

*S3 Buckets*

[What are S3 Buckets]
Simply, put they are infrastructure that hold/contain S3 Objects
- Can have folders that also hold objects
- Allows users to set permissions and control access to buckets
- Users can store where geographically the buckets are stored
-- NOTE: S3 is a universal namespace, so bucket names must be unique (similar to an email within a domain)

- Supports encryption

- Various types of Buckets

-- General Purpose Bucket (original bucket type) 
--- Flat hierarchy storage (no subfolders)
--- Used with all storage classes EXCEPT S3 Express One Zone storage class
--- Default limit of 100 general buckets per account

-- Directory Buckets
--- Folder hierarchy
--- Only be used with S3 Express One Zone storage class (single-digit millisecond performance on PUT and GET)
--- Allows individual directories to scale horizontally
--- 10 directory buckets per account

**Bucket Structure**
- Bucket Folders
-- Technically not creating folders, its a 0 Byte S3 object that ends with a '/', indicating that its a folder
--- Dont include metadata, permissions, and dont contain anything (cant be full or empty)

**Rules**

- Bucket naming rules
-- Bucket names are used to form URL links for HTTP/S operations, and therefore follow similar rules
-- 3-63 characters
-- lowercase, number, periods, and hyphens allowed (no uppercase, underscore, or spaces)
-- must begin and end with alphanumeric
-- no two adjacent periods in a row
-- cant be an IP format
-- some prefixes are restricted due to other uses ('xn--', 'sthree-', 'sthree-configurator', etc)
-- some suffixes are restricted ('-s3alias' and '--ol=s3')
-- Must be unique across all AWS accounts and regions
--- Bucket must be deleted before it's name can be reused
-- If bucket is used with S3 Transfer Acceleration, it cant have periods in its name

- Restrictions/Limitations
-- By default can have 100 buckets (can create service request for up to 1000 buckets)

- must empty a bucket before you can delete it

- no max size for a bucket, nor max object count for a bucket
-- Files in a bucket must be between 0 Bytes and 5 TBs, however
-- Any file above 100MB should use a multi-part upload

- S3 for AWS Outposts has limits (see Outpost section)

- GET, PUT, LIST, and DELETE operations are designed for high availability/use
-- CREATE or CONFIGURATION operations should be run less often\

*Sub-Topics*

S3 Bucket URI
- URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a way to reference the address of S3 buckets and S3 objects
-- s3://myexamplebucket/photo.jpg

S3 CLI
- 'aws s3' : High-level way to interact wiht S3 buckets and objects
- 'aws s3api' : Low-level way to interact (must less day-to-day. Fine tuned control)
- 'aws s3control' : Manages s3 access points, s3 batch operations, storage lens
- 'aws s3outposts' : Manges endpoints for s3 outposts

-------------------

*S3 Endpoints*

Standard Endpoints (IPv4)

Dual-Stack Endpoints (IPv4 and IPv6)

-------------------

*S3 Storage Classes*

Different classes find balance between price and functionality. Following are most-to-least expensive

- S3 Standard (fast, available, durable)
-- Default storage class
-- 11 '9s' durability (99.999999999%)
-- 4 '9s' availability
-- Redundancy with 3+ Availability Zones (AZ)
-- Uses: CDN, Big Data analytics, mobile/gaming apps, etc
- S3 Intelligent Tiering
-- Uses ML to analyze object usage and determine storage class tier (below)
--- Frequent Access tier (default): remains while being accessed
--- Infrequent Access Tier: moved after 30 days of no access
--- Archive Instant Access Tier: moved after 90 days
--- Deep Archive Access tier: moved after 180 days
- S3 Express One Zone
-- Single digit ms performance (special bucket type)
-- Does not rely on multiple AZ (redundancy issue in exchange for speed)
- S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)
-- If you access less than once a month
- S3 One-Zone-IA
-- same concept as above IA
-- 11 '9s' durabiility
-- 3 '9s' availability (slower than S3 standard)
-- Redundancy with 3+ AZ
-- Uses: Disaster Recovery, Backups, or other long-term data that isnt frequently accessed

|NOTE|
S3 Glacier is a separate stand-alone service. The following storage classes are similar functionality, but not technically the S3 Glacier service

- S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
-- Long-term storage, but data is instantly available
-- No attachment to S3 Glacier Vault service
-- Uses: data that is RARELY accessed, but provides IMMEDIATE access in the event that its needed (rule of thumb is 'accessed once a quarter')
-- Image hosting, online file-sharing, medical imaging, health records, etc
- S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
-- Has 3 retrieval tiers (1min-12hour)
--- Expedited (1-5min): 250MB limit
--- Standard (3-5hour): No limit / Default option
--- Bulk Tier (5-12hour)
-- Uses/Attached to S3 Glacier Vault service
- S3 Glacier Deep Archive
-- Has 2 retrieval tiers (1min-12hour)
--- Standard (9-12hour): Default option
--- Bulk Tier (12-48hour)
-- Uses/Attached to S3 Glacier Vault service
